# Quality Assurance and Testing with Chai (freeCodeCamp Project)

> This repository contains the completed challenges for the "Quality Assurance and Testing with Chai" module from the freeCodeCamp Quality Assurance curriculum. It demonstrates the use of various assertion methods to perform unit and functional testing in a Node.js environment.

## About The Project

This project involves a series of challenges designed to teach the fundamentals of software testing. Starting with a boilerplate Node.js and Express application, the goal is to fix a suite of pre-written tests by implementing the correct assertion methods from the Chai library. The tests are run using the Mocha test framework.

The challenges cover everything from basic assertions (`isNull`, `isDefined`) to more complex functional tests involving API endpoints and headless browser testing with Zombie.js.

## Technologies Used

* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
* **Testing Framework:** Mocha
* **Assertion Library:** Chai
* **Headless Browser Testing:** Zombie.js
